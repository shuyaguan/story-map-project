Pennsylvania Charging Stations Map

This project presents a map of charging stations across Pennsylvania, highlighting the spatial distribution characteristics and specific locations in different regions. The map aims to provide a clear and comprehensive visualization of where charging stations are concentrated and how they are distributed in both urban and rural areas.

Target Audience：
This project is intended for:
Electric vehicle (EV) owners and potential EV buyers who are looking for convenient charging station locations.
Urban planners and policymakers interested in the spatial distribution of EV infrastructure.
Researchers analyzing trends in clean energy and infrastructure development.

Data Source：
The data used for this project is sourced from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)'s Alternative Fueling Station Locator, providing accurate and up-to-date information on charging stations.

Code Source：
The initial code structure for this project was forked from bairunnn/storymap-template. Significant modifications and adaptations have been made to tailor the code for mapping the spatial distribution of charging stations in Pennsylvania. All the customizations, such as data integration, visualization enhancements, and additional features, have been developed specifically for this project.
Where applicable, attribution has been provided in the code comments to acknowledge the original template's functionality.
